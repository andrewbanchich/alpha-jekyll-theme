A clean, super minimal responsive template geared towards startups, app devs, and other
dedicated folks working tirelessly to launch their products. Includes a landing page,
generic page, contact page, and a page with a whole mess of pre-styled elements (something
new I'm trying out). Sass sources are also included.

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
